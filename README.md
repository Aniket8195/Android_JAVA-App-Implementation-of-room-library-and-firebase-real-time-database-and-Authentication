Android JAVA App: Implementation of Room Library, Firebase Real-time Database, and Authentication
This Android app is developed to showcase the implementation of multiple activities, utilizing Room library for local data storage, Firebase authentication for user registration and login, and Firebase real-time database for remote data storage.

Features
User Registration and Login: On the first screen of the app, users can either register themselves or login if they already have an account.

Second Screen Buttons: The second screen of the app contains two buttons:

Submit Button: This button is used to add the values entered by the user on the first screen into the database. The values will be added to both the local database (SQLite) and the remote database (Firebase).
